					rest of the world.
				</h3>
				<h5>Therefore, we have the unique and proud distinction of being...</h5>

				<h3>
					No one should have to go through what we did to get our Brazilian Jiu-jitsu training - and <span>to
						bring the system to Canada for the first time in history. </span> We traveled thousands of
					miles, made all kinds of personal and financial sacrifices and routinely had to face down threats
					and even physical violence. It wasn’t cheap, it wasn’t easy and it sure wasn’t always fun - but
					<span>we felt it was well worth the sacrifices and was something we had to do.</span>
				</h3>
				<h3>
					Back in those days, before the UFC or MMA even existed, we had no idea how popular BJJ would
					eventually
					become and we didn’t really care. <span>We didn’t do it to make ourselves popular</span> or to
					follow a fad. We didn’t do
					it to get a new belt or a cheap tournament medal - or whatever other trivial stuff motivates the BJJ
					community these days.
				</h3>
				<h3>
					We did it because <span>we were in the midst of a historic crime wave</span> and saw what the
					epidemic of interpersonal violence was doing to our communities and society. We did it because
					<span> we`d had enough</span> of a martial arts establishment that had betrayed the trust and
					utterly failed the very people that needed it the most. And we did it because we knew
					<span>something had to be done</span> about a “self-defence” industry so irresponsible that it
					didn’t seem to care if it got <span>people humiliated, hurt - or worse.</span>

							<p>
								
Somewhere along the path of tremendous growth and popularity during the 1970s and 80s, the martial arts world had lost its way- and its honour. There were now so many martial arts schools and so much unfounded opinion and untested self-defence theories, that it had become "an embarrassment of riches"-emphasis on the "embarrassment" part.
The "self-defence" industry was becoming a bad joke and the people who faced real life violence didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The once proud and noble world of martial arts had become a comical parody of itself. A world of short men telling tall tales, of glorified day-care center Karate and guaranteed "Black Belt" Tae kwon Do. A world where the "ass- kickers* were now "ass-kissers" and the self-defence "expert" was just about the worst person to learn self-defence from.
The public deserved better than a burlesque show of stereotypical, chest thumping "deadly masters"- who had never been in a real fight, except against obesity and obesity won. Or the dark comedy of narcissistic "champions", battling more addictions and criminal
charges then they did ring opponents. People badly needed alternatives to movie inspired fantasy or drug and ego fuelled combat sports. Sports that caused more brain trauma and injuries in the gym then they ever prevented on the street. Someone needed to tell all the "great-grand masters" that: "the emperor has no clothes

				<h2>OUR PROMISE <span>TO YOU</span></h2>
				<div class="opty-title-border"></div>
				<p>As the original, and only actual “first generation”, Gracie/Brazilian Jiu-jitsu Academy in Canada, we
					are as “old school” as it gets. We were there from the beginning, so we have seen all the changes
					BJJ and MMA have gone through over the years- as well as the new generation of practitioners and
					instructors. Many of these changes and people have had a positive impact- but regrettably many have
					not.</p>
				<p>
					<span>We believe you deserve only the very best that BJJ has to offer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>Our promise to you, is that we will never compromise on the ethics, technical training methods or
					real life effectiveness of the authentic old school Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and MMA (Vale Tudo) system.
					We call this the “old School” way.</p>

					<img src="images/opty-1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
				</div>
				<div class="opty-right">
					<p>For us, “old school” means BJJ that is lived and taught as a noble martial art and the most
						complete and effective system of Self-Defence known to man- <span>not just another sport.</span>
					</p>
					<p class="opty-p">To everyone, “Old school” should always mean honor, integrity and traditional
						warrior values- not a culture of cowards, bullies and disrespect.</p>

						For all students, “old school” means your well being, personal growth and self-defence needs
						come first- <span>not someone else’s agenda of tournament scores or medal counts.</span>
					</p>
					<p class="opty-p">
						For the beginner, it means individual attention and special systematic instruction to accelerate
						your learning- <span>not sink or swim in huge impersonal group classes.</span>

						of coordination, balance and flexibility- <span>not movie fantasies of “knocking out” enormous
							men.</span>
					</p>
					<p class="opty-p">
						For the middle aged and beyond, the “old school” way is your path to longevity, a supple,
						ageless body and razor sharp mind- <span>not injuries, fear of falling and deterioration.</span>

				<h2>BENEFITS OF JIU - JITSU For Your Mind, Body and Spirit</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="bojj-cnt">
				<div class="bojj-left">
					<p>“Old school” Brazilian Jiu - jitsu took the martial arts world by storm and literally fought for
						its reputation as the the planet’s most complete, efficient and effective system of self -
						defence. But “self - defence” means so much more than just protection against physical
						aggression.</p>
					<p class="bojj-p">The healthy body that Jiu-jitsu cultivates is our first line of defence against
						illness and disease. Jiu-jitsu can be the perfect self-defence against threats like obesity and
						its deadly complications of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bojj-img">
					<img src="images/bojj-1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="bojj-cnt">
				<div class="bojj-left">
					<p>For a society that is growing older Jiu - jitsu is self - defence against aging, loss of mobility
						and arthritis. For young and old alike BJJ brings people together and guards us not only from
						boredom and aimlessness but against disconnection and isolation.</p>
					<p class="bojj-p">Yet for many, their greatest adversary is their own mind. Stress and anxiety can
						be more harmful than physical attacks. But learning to be calm in the face of danger vanquishes
						fear, doubt and worry and is the very essence of Jiu-jitsu training.</p>

			<div class="bojj-cnt">
				<div class="bojj-left">
					<p>If emotional traumas or fighting back against the negativity of your inner critic, makes your
						mind feel like a battleground - then Jiu - jitsu can be your invisible weapon - to slay personal
						demons and protect your psyche from within and without.</p>
					<p class="bojj-p">Thus, Jiu - jitsu is defence of the whole “self” and your entire being - your
						mind, your body and your spirit. Jiu-jitsu is like a superpower - the warrior’s ultimate secret
						weapon that no one can see but is always with you.</p>

				<p>But not everyone believes in themselves. Far too many good people worry that they do not have what it

					We want to help them realize that personal transformation and discovering your inner warrior can be
					as simple
					as making a choice. </p>
				<p>Your greatest power is not your size or your strength - its your power to choose. You have the power
